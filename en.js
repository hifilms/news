Early spoofs, glossy dramas, quick celebrity cameos, voice roles in animation, and eventually prestige television created a path few predicted. Each appearance doubled as cultural commentary, asking viewers to reconsider what fame means in modern Hollywood. Directors used her visibility as texture, while she used their platforms to stretch credibility. Step by step, the experiment worked, turning curiosity into longevity and transforming a tabloid fixture into a bankable, evolving entertainment presence.",

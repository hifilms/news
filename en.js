    "desc": "From windswept moors to neon-pink dreamhouses, Margot Robbie has mastered the art of transformation. Whether she’s channeling gothic romance, old Hollywood chaos, newsroom tension, or plastic-fantastic perfection, her on-screen fashion moments are never just costumes, they’re storytelling devices. Robbie doesn’t simply wear a look, but embodies an era, a mood, and often an entire cultural aesthetic. From corseted Victorian drama to unapologetic barbiecore and beyond, here are some of Margot Robbie’s most iconic on-screen looks.This is by far Margot Robbie’s most stunning on-screen look. In ‘Wuthering Heights,' Margot Robbie stars as Catherine “Cathy” Earnshaw opposite Jacob Elordi. In the film, her style blends Victorian-inspired, moody fashion. With textured, crimped hair and natural, wind-chapped, or freckled skin, Margot evokes the film’s intense and romantic atmosphere.",
